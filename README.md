## Aim

The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable and user-friendly system that promotes responsible driving behavior. The system detects alcohol levels in the air using an MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor and temporarily immobilizes the vehicle's engine if alcohol is detected, preventing potential accidents due to impaired driving.

## Components Required

To build the "Smart Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System," you will need the following components:

1. `Arduino Nano`
2. `MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor`
3. `DC Power Booster Module`
4. `DC Gear Motor` (used as a demonstration of a car)
5. `Charging Module`
6. `Lithium-Ion Battery`
7. `Relay Module (5V)`
8. `LED`
9. `Buzzer`
10. `SPST Switch`
11. `Connecting Wires` or `Jumper Wires`
12. `Arduino IDE` (to program Arduino Nano)

Additionally, materials like Cardboard or a Box are used for the overall structure, offering adaptability in design.

## How It Works

The operational mechanism of the "Smart Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System" involves several key steps. Follow the detailed guide in the [How It Works](#how-it-works) section to understand the system's functionality, from power supply initiation to real-time alerts and temporary system pauses.

The 'Smart Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System' operates by integrating advanced rain sensor technology into the vehicle's wiper control system. This innovation allows real-time adjustments to the wiper's speed and frequency based on rain detection. Here's a concise overview of the system's functioning:

1. **Power Supply Initiation:**
   - System begins with turning on the power supply.
   - Rechargeable battery connected to charging module via C-type USB cable for versatile and portable power.
   - DC power booster module ensures compatibility with Arduino Nano.

2. **System Control Switch:**
   - User-friendly switch controls the system's power supply.
   - Easy on/off functionality for user control.

3. **DC Gear Motor and Relay Operation:**
   - DC gear motor connected to Arduino relay interface.
   - Relay serves as intermediary, receiving Arduino signals to control the DC gear motor.

4. **Visual and Auditory Indicators:**
   - Buzzer and LED linked directly to Arduino for real-time alerts.
   - Activated upon alcohol detection for immediate and unmistakable signals.
   - Double-alert feature enhances security and improves the detection process.

5. **Alcohol Detection Process:**
   - MQ-3 alcohol sensor positioned to detect alcohol concentrations in the air.
   - Continuous monitoring for variations in alcohol levels.

6. **Data Processing by Arduino:**
   - Arduino processes information from MQ-3 sensor using complex algorithms.
   - Detects alcohol percentage as the system's control center.

7. **Relay Activation and Motor Stopping:**
   - Relay receives orders from Arduino based on analyzed data.
   - Stops DC gear motor operation in response to alcohol detection for crucial safety.

8. **Real-time Alert:**
   - User receives simultaneous visual (LED) and auditory (buzzer) alerts.
   - Dual-alert system ensures rapid and effective safety precautions.

9. **Temporary System Pause:**
   - System temporarily pauses when alerts are activated and motor is stopped.
   - Allows user to acknowledge detected alcohol levels.
   - Resumes regular functioning after a short break, enabling the DC gear motor to run again.
